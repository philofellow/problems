# problems
The repo was named mwp before, i.e., minimum weight path. It was intended to use for phd research. So, branches code and paper and about minimum weight path with mapreduce. 

However, the repo is now used for job hunting problems exercise, so renamed to problems. And specifically branch problems is used for this purpose.
